Hello. This file contains the basic idea behind this project. Special thanks to COEBASICS for providing the sample dataset and the resources for this end-to-end project.  
1. AIM OF THE PROJECT
To provide revenue insights in the hospitality domain by providing Key Perfomance Indicators(KPI's) and visuals. 

2. PROBLEM STATEMENT 
The problem statement issues by the revenue manager is to find the overall performance of th hotel chains. Furthermore we need to find the RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room), DSRN(Daily Sellable Room Nights), ADR(Average Daily Rate), DBRN(Daily Booked Room Nights) and DURN(Daily Utilized Room Nights).

3. METHOD AND PROCEDURE
I have made some changes to the original dashboard that was made in the initial project stage as per the YouTube Video. So at a very basic level, the dashboard has 5 filters available for the user namely FILTER BY CITY, FILTER BY ROOM TYPE, FILTER BY BOOKING PLATFORM, MONTH NAME and WEEK NUMBER. For the visuals I have created many calculated columns using DAX mmeasurs. You may have noticed that my .pbix file contains 5 report pages that are hidden. This is because they are being used as tooltip pages to show a graph when the user hovers over the cards that i have created in the center left of the report. For ease of understanding I have also created a text box that contains all the full forms of the abbreviations.

4. FINAL RESULTS TO STAKEHOLDERS
The final result to the stakeholders is the Project Practice Hotel Dashboard.pbix file that contains all the KPI's and visuals that are necessary for our stakeholders(in our case its our domain's revenue manager).
